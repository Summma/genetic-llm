Make a priority function that should take into account the nature of this specific differential equation:
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}, \quad 0 < x < L, \quad y > 0

With boundary conditions:
u(0, y) = 0, \quad u(L, y) = 0, \quad u(x, 0) = C \sinh\left(\frac{\pi x}{L}\right),

Implement the priority function around the goal of solving the differential equation.
The operators may look like
binary operators: ["+", "-", "*", "/"]
unary operators: ["sin", "cos", "exp"]

Evolve the following function:
```python
def priority(operator_list, operator) -> float:
    """
    operator_list: list of mathematical operators
    operator: specific operator from the operator list

    Return a priority value for the given operator
    """

    return 0.0
```
